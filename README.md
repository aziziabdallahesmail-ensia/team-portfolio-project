## Team Retrospective Analysis

Our team's development of the portfolio website was a practical exercise in managing a collaborative Git workflow. The process provided significant insights into the challenges and benefits of industry-standard development practices.

The most significant technical challenge we encountered was the management of merge conflicts within the shared index.html file. Since every team member needed to add their personal hyperlink to this single file, it became a centralized point of contention. This required constant communication and a disciplined approach to regularly pulling the latest changes from the develop branch into our individual feature branches before pushing our own work. It underscored the importance of frequent, small commits to minimize the complexity of potential conflicts.

A specific merge conflict occurred when two members added their profile links to index.html on the same line. To resolve this, the team member with the conflict followed a clear procedure: they pulled the latest develop branch into their feature branch, which triggered the conflict locally. They then opened index.html in their editor, which showed the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). They manually edited the file to correctly include both hyperlinks, removed the conflict markers, saved the file, and committed the resolution with the message fix: Resolve merge conflict with upstream develop. This ensured both contributions were preserved.

The pull request and peer review process proved highly effective in enhancing the final quality of our project. It served as a critical quality gate, preventing direct pushes to the develop branch and ensuring all code was reviewed by at least one other person. This process helped us catch minor errors, such as broken links or typos, and maintain a consistent coding style across all files. More importantly, it fostered a sense of shared ownership and improved our collective understanding of the codebase.
